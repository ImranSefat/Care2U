# INSPIRATION

The very world we know and love is changing by the second due to the
spread of COVID-19. Though we may think that this pandemic is
bound to end soon, it is only the beginning. After witnessing pictures
of exhausted medical staffs currently working day and night to fight
this disease risking their lives, we started to set our complaints about
social distancing aside, and started to focus on the issue at hand.

At the forefront of this pandemic, shortages of supplies have gotten so
bad, that staff and support facilities have had to reuse supplies such as
surgical masks, inducing severe health hazards. Seeing all this unfold
before us we wanted to do something about the situation and that
triggered the idea of Care2U.



# WHAT IT DOES?

Care2U is a platform that allows the hospitals to register themselves
and fill in the information regarding the supplies they have and the
things they require. The public, which includes communities and
organizations, can see the current resources and demands of hospitals
of the particular area where they wish to donate. Using this system,
people and organizations with extra supplies can find the right centers
to donate to and assist the community from within the site. Upon
receiving donation, the inventory of the hospital update accordingly.

To ensure the users are up-to-date with recent updates, they can view
the COVID-19 status of Bangladesh from Home page.



# WHATâ€™S NEXT?

We will continue adding the database of National ID and public
hospitals through government approval. We are looking forward to
expanding our reach to the whole country. Finally, we also wish to
attract foreign nations if they want to provide any general aid to the
government.
