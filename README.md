# INSPIRATION

The very world we know and love is changing by the second due to the
spread of COVID-19. Though we may think that this pandemic is
bound to end soon, it is only the beginning. After witnessing pictures
of exhausted medical staffs currently working day and night to fight
this disease risking their lives, we started to set our complaints about
social distancing aside, and started to focus on the issue at hand.

At the forefront of this pandemic, shortages of supplies have gotten so
bad, that staff and support facilities have had to reuse supplies such as
surgical masks, inducing severe health hazards. Seeing all this unfold
before us we wanted to do something about the situation and that
triggered the idea of Care2U.



# WHAT IT DOES?

Care2U is a platform that allows the hospitals to register themselves
and fill in the information regarding the supplies they have and the
things they require. The public, which includes communities and
organizations, can see the current resources and demands of hospitals
of the particular area where they wish to donate. Using this system,
people and organizations with extra supplies can find the right centers
to donate to and assist the community from within the site. Upon
receiving donation, the inventory of the hospital update accordingly.

Such inventory may include plasma donation. The hospital records of
recovered patients and their necessary contact and medical
information are to be inputted. These can be recovered from the
hospital database itself or they can provide. Of course the terms and
permission of the patients are to be acknowledged as well as the
hospitals too along with all the necessary confidentiality. Therefore in
case of the need of plasma, hospitals can put up a request and donors
may find themselves. Also because of the previous record of donors
and recovered patients and of course being under their permission,
hospitals may seek them directly through the combined database we
would provide and personally request for help regarding their need
which in most cases would include plasma.

# WHATâ€™S NEXT?

We will continue adding the database of National ID and public
hospitals through government approval. We are looking forward to
expanding our reach to the whole country. Finally, we also wish to
attract foreign nations if they want to provide any general aid to the
government.
